pepitoDT1:Pépito... Main enemy of the game. You hear his footsteps, be aware of him.
pepitoDT2:Pépito... You'll hear his footsteps from left or right, close the respective door. Sound is directional.
pepitoDT3:Pépito again? He appears on the cameras. You can use the Metal Pipe to scare him away immediately. <<<Enable headphones in settings if you can't hear direction.>>>
notPepitoDT1:NotPepito... He's kinda like Pépito. Be ready for anything, react immediately.
notPepitoDT2:NotPepito again.. gonna be a tough one. Lights flicker and you hear his running.
notPepitoDT3:NotPepito yet again. Running sounds, flickering lights, very fast. Otherwise similar to Pépito.
uncannyDT1:Uncanny Cat... When he's present, take your hands off.
uncannyDT2:Uncanny Cat again. Don't move, don't press keys. Be aware and react quickly.
uncannyDT3:Uncanny Cat. Don't make unnecessary movements. You can use the adblocker to suppress him for one night. Adblockers appear in the camera, click them and follow further instructions to obtain.
msiDT1:MSI... Scary one. Listen to his commands. LEFT. RIGHT. LEFT. RIGHT.
msiDT2:MSI. Move in the directions he mentions. Moving in the wrong direction results in: DEATH.
msiDT3:MSI again, huh. Move LEFT and RIGHT. If you're really struggling use the flashlight on him, but Glitcher appears. At high difficulty consecutive similar commands may appear.
astartaDT1:Astarta... You see her eyes in doorframes. That's your cue.
astartaDT2:Astarta again. Her eyes will appear in the door frames. After some time they will flicker, and then she will attack. Close the door.
astartaDT3:Astarta. You don't have to wait for her eyes to flicker. Flash the Flashlight in the door frame to scare her away.
colaDT1:ColaCat... Your soda will start corrupting and become red after some time. Once you notice it, use it before it's too late.
colaDT2:ColaCat again. In Classic, he appears only when Soda is used with Metal Pipe or Flashlight. Mini Sodas does not get affected by ColaCat.
colaDT3:ColaCat. It's quite simple. Soda go red -> Drink Soda. Only appears with certain item combos, or in Challenge mode. Mini and Mega Sodas does not get affected by ColaCat.
makiDT1:Maki... Maki's footsteps are not directional. You will need to look in the camera to see what direction she will go to.
makiDT2:Maki again? Maki will indicate her direction with a red exclamation mark too. Your last resort will be using the Metal Pipe.
makiDT3:How.
sharkDT1:Shark... Avoid green squares. Do not let him touch the fish.
sharkDT2:Shark again? The Flood is an entire 1 minute sequence. Avoid green squares!
sharkDT3:Shark. The Flood is an entire 1 minute sequence. You can make the Flood go by 2x faster using the Fan. Green squares will appear, make the fish avoid them at all cost.
lemonDT1:Lemonade Cat... Right-Click to throw lemons at him.
lemonDT2:Lemonade Cat again. Throw him some lemons. They take a bit to reach him. If you run out -
lemonDT3:Lemonade Cat. Throw lemons a bit ahead. Landing a successful hit gives you 1 back. Don't rush as to not run out and die.
scaryCatDT1:Scary Cat... he will try to get in your view. Move away.
scaryCatDT2:Scary Cat is very forgiving. Move away. He will go away in a bit of time.
scaryCatDT3:Scary Cat is very forgiving. Move away from him constantly. The encounter lasts some time, but he's not necessarily your main priority if move away at the right time.
elAstartaDT1:El Astarta... Close doors with eyes. Do not get confused. Survive.
elAstartaDT2:El Astarta again... It's a sequence that lasts 40 seconds. El Astarta's eyes will appear in door frames and strike very fast. New doors will appear. Survive.
elAstartaDT3:El Astarta. Sequence lasts 40 seconds. Eyes appear in door frames and strike very fast. New doors begin to appear. Flashlight WON'T work.
shockDT1:Shock... He hacks the computer before attacking you. It's evident which door he's gonna use.
shockDT2:Shock again... He's gonna appear on your monitor with a respective sound cue before rushing you. The door he's gonna use lights up.
shockDT3:Shock. He appears on the monitor, plays a sound. Then starts his DOOM phase and runs through one of the doors.
dscDT1:Deep Sea Creature... It's almost like the flood. You get a gun to shoot him though!
dscDT2:Deep Sea Creature again. He floods your entire room. However, you get a harpoon. Shoot him. Moving around slows him down!!!
dscDT3:Deep Sea Creature. After the flood you have to shoot him continuously. The harpoon needs some time to cool off inbetween. Don't miss. Moving around means he needs more time to reach you!!!
radiationDT:Avoid your cursor from entering green circles, they indicate radiation. If you reach too much radiation you WILL die.
afterTheFirstNuclearStrike:After the first nuclear strike, you must IMMEDIATELY travel to the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where Lake Toba is located. On this Lake Toba there is the island of Samosir. On the island of Samosir there is a Lutheran church "GEREJA HKBP BOLON PANGURURAN". Opposite this church there is a hill where my tent will be located!!! - Larry Zhou
