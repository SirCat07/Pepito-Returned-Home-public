pepitoDT1:Pépito... Main enemy of the game. You'll hear his footsteps from left or right, close the respective door. Sound is directional.
pepitoDT2:Pépito again? Use the Metal Pipe to scare him away immediately. Enable headphones in settings if you're struggling with the direction.
pepitoDT3:Pépito. Footsteps. Close door. Figure it out, I believe in you.
notPepitoDT1:NotPepito... He's kinda like Pépito. Just faster. Way faster. React immediately. Lights will flicker.
notPepitoDT2:NotPepito again.. gonna be a tough one. Lights flicker and you hear his footsteps. Just need to react faster.
notPepitoDT3:Eventually you'll get used to it.
uncannyDT1:Uncanny Cat... when you see him appear stop moving or pressing keys IMMEDIATELY. He will give you two strikes until you die.
uncannyDT2:Uncanny Cat again.. do. not. MOVE.                                    You can use the adblocker to suppress him for one night. Adblockers appear in the camera.
uncannyDT3:Chill, stop moving so much already.
msiDT1:MSI... Scary one. Move left or right at his command. Left, then right, then left, then right, then left...
msiDT2:MSI again, huh. If you're really struggling use the flashlight on him, but that will summon Glitcher. Move LEFT and RIGHT.
msiDT3:LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT. You'll learn it eventually.
astartaDT1:Astarta... Her eyes will appear in the door frames. After some time they will flicker, and then she will attack. Close the door.
astartaDT2:Astarta again. Close the doors earlier if you want to, or just use the Flashlight in the door frame to scare her away.
astartaDT3:Astarta. You'll meet this one a lot.
colaDT1:ColaCat... Your soda will start corrupting and become red after some time, and if you don't drink it you will die.
colaDT2:ColaCat again. In Classic he appears only when Soda is  used with Metal Pipe or Flashlight. Mini Soda does not get affected by ColaCat.
colaDT3:Soda go red -> Drink Soda.
makiDT1:Maki... Maki's footsteps are not directional. You will need to look in the camera to see what direction she will go to.
makiDT2:Maki again? Maki will indicate her direction with a red exclamation mark too. Your last resort will be using the Metal Pipe.
makiDT3:How.
sharkDT1:Shark... The Flood is an entire 1 minute sequence. You can make the Flood go 2x faster using the Fan. Green squares will appear, make the fish avoid them at all cost.
sharkDT2:Shark again? You can make the Flood go 2x faster using the Fan. Green squares will appear, make the fish avoid them at all cost.
sharkDT3:Avoid green squares.
lemonDT1:Lemonade Cat... Right-Click to throw lemons at him. Lemons take a bit to reach him, so go a bit ahead.
lemonDT2:Lemonade Cat again. Aim BETTER. THROW THOSE LEMONS. DONT RUN OUT.
lemonDT3:Aim better PLEASE.
scaryCatDT1:Scary Cat... he will try to go in the center of your view. Move and don't let him reach you. After some time he will disappear.
scaryCatDT2:Scary Cat is very forgiving, i don't know how you are dying. But move your camera away from him.
scaryCatDT3:Move your camera.
elAstartaDT1:El Astarta... Sequence that lasts 40 seconds. El Astarta's eyes will appear in door frames and strike very fast. New doors will appear. Survive.
elAstartaDT2:El Astarta again... Close doors with eyes. Do not get confused. Survive.
elAstartaDT3:Survive.
radiationDT:Avoid your cursor from entering green circles, they indicate radiation. If you reach too much radiation you WILL die.
afterTheFirstNuclearStrike:After the first nuclear strike, you must IMMEDIATELY travel to the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where Lake Toba is located. On this Lake Toba there is the island of Samosir. On the island of Samosir there is a Lutheran church "GEREJA HKBP BOLON PANGURURAN". Opposite this church there is a hill where my tent will be located!!! - Larry Zhou
